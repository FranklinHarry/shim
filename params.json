{"name":"Shim","tagline":"Userify Shim","body":"shim\r\n====\r\n\r\nThe Userify shim creates users, manages sudo permissions, etc based on\r\nthe user accounts that you've configured in the Userify web console (https://console.userify.com)\r\nor through the API. It wakes up once every 90 seconds, checks for things to do,\r\nand goes back to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe shim is designed to be extremely lightweight and easy to integrate and\r\ncustomize into cloudinit, chef recipes, puppet manifests, RPMs, DEBs,...\r\nWe're here to help. If you experience any issues, let us know.\r\n\r\nIt has zero requirements beyond what is included in every major distribution today.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe Userify shim is very short (please read it for yourself)\r\nand only requires:\r\n\r\n*  Linux 2.6 or later\r\n*  curl (command-line), sudo\r\n*  Python 2.6 or later (for httplib timeout, simplejson)\r\n*  HTTPS access to shim.userify.com (currently proxies are not supported)\r\n\r\nThese basics are *built-in* to most Linux distributions made in the last five years,\r\nincluding Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, SUSE, Gentoo,\r\nand derivatives. Need FreeBSD or other UNIX? Get in touch with specific\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTested distributions: RHEL6, CentOS6, Debian 7 (wheezy) and later,\r\nUbuntu 12.04 and later.  (Please notify with testing results.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does the installer do?\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n*   Create /opt/userify and credentials file in it (creds.py)\r\n*   Patch /etc/rc.local (/etc/init.d/after.local on SUSE)\r\n    with a link to the daemon\r\n*   Creates an uninstall script at /opt/userify/uninstall.sh\r\n*   Kicks off shim every 90 seconds\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom Integration\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nWant to disable automatic updates or deploy a custom Userify shim package?\r\nThe only requirements are\r\nshim.py and creds.py (can be derived from your Userify Project page).\r\nDon't forget to protect creds.py:\r\n\r\n    chmod 600 /opt/userify/creds.py\r\n    chown root:root /opt/userify/creds.py\r\n    \r\n    \r\nUsing an older Linux version such as RHEL5? You can easily specify a modern Python binary (2.6 or later) by setting the PYTHON environment\r\nvariable before calling shim.sh in /etc/rc.local:\r\n\r\n    PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.6 /opt/userify/shim.sh &\r\n\r\n\r\nGet In Touch\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWe are available to assist with questions, custom installations, directory\r\nintegrations or deployments, self-hosted installations, and professional\r\nconsulting. Please open an issue with your question or contact support for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
